TicTacToe

This is my second android app ever! I created this on my own to learn different aspects of Android Studio and to further learn
to create android apps. The game has 1 Player, 2 Player, and Red Vs Green game modes. The app was originally going to be just a 2 player
pass-and-play version of tic-tac-toe to help me learn more about making apps, but I got carried away and decided to add a few more modes
just for fun because why not? The main purpose of the other modes was still to learn how to create android apps than to create the most
efficient code. This app is not published on Google Play since it was merely for learning purposes and fun.

1 Player Mode:

        Easy - just randomly places a mark - "Play this mode if you need to feel good about yourself or just win for once"
        Hard - Will place marks in the better locations - "Play against someone who actually knows what they are doing"
        Impossible - Will place in best location almost all the time - "You have a 99% chance of not winning. DISCLAIMER: Actual
			odds, unless you know the secret..."
     
     
2 Player Mode:

       Play against a friend as a pass-and-play.
      
      
Red Vs Green:

        This mode was created because of an inside joke with my friends. I was on the Green Team and he was on the Red. Green, of
        course, always wins with clearly no cheating...
        



POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATES (IF I EVER HAVE TIME):

        Learn how to add sounds to app to play for win someone wins or loses or on button clicks
        
        Learn how to make the 2 Player mode play between 2 different devices (via both bluetooth and WiFi) as well as still having
        the pass-and-play option.
